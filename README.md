## About Me

> Above all things, I am a curious person. My curiosity has led me to delve into, learn and master a diverse skillset in the fields of science, engineering and technology.

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science (Honours) Degree in Electronics & Computer Engineering at the UNAM School of Engineering & the Built Environment.

As a hobby, I write books, design flyers and logos, and read ancient Greek philosophy. I have dabbled in voiceover work, public speaking, and physical fitness. Browse my real estate on the net and learn more about a potential business partner, employee, or friend.
